What is a Design Pattern?
-------------------------

Before diving into MVVM, it's helpful to understand what a *design pattern* is in software development.
A design pattern is a reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software design.
It's not a code snippet you can copy and paste, but rather a **template or blueprint** for
how to structure your code to achieve a specific goal—such as *separation of concerns*,
*code reusability*, *flexibility*, or *testability*.

Design patterns are often derived from years of experience by expert developers who have
encountered and solved similar problems across various projects and domains. They help
standardize the way developers tackle common challenges, making code easier to understand,
maintain, and scale.

There are different categories of design patterns, including:

- **Creational Patterns** – Deal with object creation mechanisms (e.g., *Singleton*, *Factory Method*).
- **Structural Patterns** – Help organize classes and objects (e.g., *Adapter*, *Decorator*, *Composite*).
- **Behavioral Patterns** – Focus on communication between objects (e.g., *Observer*, *Strategy*, *Command*).

In modern application development—especially in UI-heavy or event-driven
environments—**architectural patterns** like *MVC* (Model-View-Controller),
*MVVM* (Model-View-ViewModel), and *MVP* (Model-View-Presenter) have emerged as
higher-level design patterns. These help in organizing application logic and user
interfaces in a modular, maintainable way.

By using design patterns, developers can avoid reinventing the wheel, reduce bugs,
and collaborate more efficiently through a shared vocabulary of solutions.



The Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) Pattern
---------------------------------------

MVVM is an architectural design pattern specifically designed for
applications with user interfaces (UIs). It aims to separate the UI (the
View) from the underlying data and logic (the Model) by introducing an
intermediary component called the ViewModel. This separation makes the
application more maintainable, testable, and easier to evolve.

The MVVM pattern consists of three core components:

-  **Model:** The Model represents the *data* and the *business logic*
   of the application. It's responsible for:

   -  Data storage (e.g., reading from and writing to a database, a
      file, or an API).
   -  Data validation (ensuring the data is in a valid state).
   -  Business rules (the logic that governs how the data is manipulated
      and used).

The Model is agnostic to the UI. It doesn't know anything about how the
data will be displayed or how the user will interact with it. It simply
provides the data and the means to manipulate it.

-  **View:** The View is the *user interface* (UI) of the application.
   It's responsible for:

   -  Displaying data to the user.
   -  Capturing user input (e.g., button clicks, text entered in a
      field, selections from a dropdown).
   -  Presenting the application's visual appearance.

The View is *passive*. It doesn't contain any business logic or data
manipulation code. It simply displays the data provided to it and relays
user actions to the ViewModel.

-  **ViewModel:** The ViewModel acts as an *intermediary* between the
   Model and the View. It's responsible for:

   -  Preparing data from the Model for display in the View. This might
      involve formatting the data, combining data from multiple sources,
      or creating derived data.
   -  Handling user actions from the View. This might involve validating
      user input, updating the Model, or triggering other actions in the
      application.
   -  Exposing data and commands to the View through *data binding*.

The ViewModel knows about the View and the data that the View needs, but
it doesn't know about the specific UI components that are used to
display the data. It also orchestrates the interaction between the View
and the Model.
